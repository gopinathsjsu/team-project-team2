## XP Core Values Implemented:

- **Communication**

* Communication played huge role in our team. We had scrum calls twice a week, where we discussed the 
* progress of each team member, thereby making necessary decisions and further roadmap.

- **Feedback**

* Each one of the team members gave feedback to one another in the team, during the testing phase, which 
* greatly helped us in identifying the bugs. Code has been committed to master after proper review and 
* feedback from the team.

* Throughout the project, each one of us had valued and considered others ideas and suggestions and respected each others availability and timeline.
